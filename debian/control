Description: Show Me The Money is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker program
 smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a 
 simple stock ticker and charting application. It creates and automatically 
 updates a window with stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance, as well as optional
 charts from Yahoo! Finance. 
 .
 smtm is fully configurable -- it can display the stock symbol and the full
 name of the company, the price change, the percentage change, the volume
 traded, the profit or loss, the value of the holding, the length of the
 holding period, annualised percentage returns and more. The display can be 
 sorted on almost any of the columns.  Losers are flagged in red. smtm can be
 used for most global stock symbols, North American mutual funds and options,
 currencies and some commodities -- anything supported Yahoo! Finance.
 .
 Stock quotes are normally delayed, 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20
 minutes otherwise, see Yahoo! Finance for details.
